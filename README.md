- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Ready for Vercel, Netlify, or any Node.js hosting

## API Configuration

### OpenAI (Default)

The app uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model by default. Set your API key in `.env.local`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### DeepSeek (Alternative)

To use DeepSeek instead, modify `src/app/api/check-tone/route.ts` and update the API configuration.

## Customization

### Modify the AI Prompt

Edit the system prompt in `src/app/api/check-tone/route.ts` to change how the AI analyzes text.

### Styling

The app uses a Spotify-inspired theme defined in `tailwind.config.js`. Customize the colors:

- `spotify-green`: Primary accent color
- `spotify-black`: Main background
- `spotify-darkgray`: Card backgrounds
- `spotify-lightgray`: Secondary backgrounds

### Analysis Delay

Change the debounce delay in `src/components/ToneChecker.tsx` (currently 1000ms).

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### Other Platforms

The app is a standard Next.js application and can be deployed anywhere that supports Node.js.
